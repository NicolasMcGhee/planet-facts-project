# How I Worked on this project
My goal was to get better at CSS and media queries and it paid off.
* The site is fully responsive, smoothly going for desktop, tablet, and then mobile.
* Overview, internal, and surface which render their respective info through active states.
* Mobile has a dropdown menu allowing for easy navigation.

# How to navigate this project.
* Where the main logic and layout of the site takes place: [Example Code](https://github.com/NicolasMcGhee/planet-facts-project/blob/main/components/Planet.js)
* Props being used for each page: [Example Code](https://github.com/NicolasMcGhee/planet-facts-project/blob/main/src/pages/Earth.js)
* CSS: [Example Code](https://github.com/NicolasMcGhee/planet-facts-project/blob/main/src/styles/Planet.module.css)

#Why I built this project this way
* I like Next.js
* The main focus of the project was to grow my skill in CSS and media queries and thanks to this project, I have GREATLY improved my ability with both of them. Even though the project is straight forward with the only logic needed really was state for the mobile menu, ternary for the CSS and props, I'm very happy with how this turned out and looking forward to my next challenge.
